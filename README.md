# TrinketTinker - Stardew Valley Trinket Framework

This is a framework for creating trinkets that can have advanced abilities using just [Content Patcher](https://github.com/Pathoschild/StardewMods/tree/stable/ContentPatcher).

## What can this framework do?

- Animated companions with various movement patterns.
- A skin system (variants) for companions, and related features to set/change companion variants
- Dynamic event based abilities that work through the companions rather than the player.
- Support for custom effects from other C# mods, through the use of actions.
- Have the player obtain trinket effects without actually having the trinket slot unlocked, through the use of special trigger actions.

If you are looking to make mods using this framework, [start here](guide/0-Trinket.md).

# TrinketTinker - Stardew Valley Trinket Framework

This is a framework for creating custom trinkets using [Content Patcher](https://github.com/Pathoschild/StardewMods/tree/stable/ContentPatcher).

## What can this framework do?

- Animated companions with various movement patterns.
- A skin system (variants) for companions, and related features to set/change companion variants
- Dynamic event based abilities that work through the companions rather than the player.
- Some support for custom effects from other C# mods, through the use of actions.

If you are looking to make mods using this framework, [start here](guide/0-Trinket.md).

This mod is licensed under MIT, contributions are welcome.

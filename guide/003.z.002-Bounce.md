# Bounce

Like [Lerp](003.z.000-Lerp.md) motion, but the companion bounces up and down periodically.

To have the companion show an alternate animation while bouncing, set a `"Jump"` [animation clip](003.2-Animation%20Clips.md) with the desired frame start, frame length, etc.

The difference between Bounce and [Hop](003.z.003-Hop.md) is that bounce calculates bounces independent of lerp start and end, it also provides squashing for deforming the sprite when hitting the ground.

# Anchor Mode

A companion's motion is relative to another entity's position, generally the player.

`Anchors` consist of a list of [AnchorTargetData](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.AnchorTargetData.yml)

The order matters as companion will try for anchors in order, and stop once a target is found for a given anchor mode.
When no targets are found, fallback to `Owner`.

## Sample

```json
{
  "Action": "EditData",
  "Target": "mushymato.TrinketTinker/Tinker",
  "TargetField": [
    "{{ModId}}_Sample",
    "Motion"
  ],
  "Entries": {
    "Anchors": [
      {
        "Id": "<string unique id>",
        "Mode": "<enum anchor target>",
        "Range": <int search range>,
        "StopRange": <int stop range>,
        "Filters": [
          "<mode dependent filter 1>",
          "<mode dependent filter 2>",
          //...
        ],
        "RequiredAbilities": [
          "<ability class 1>",
          "<ability class 2>",
          //...
        ]
      },
      //...
    ]
  }
}
```

## Structure

| -------- | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| `Id` | string | _same as `Mode`_ | The Id of this anchor target, used for content patcher EditData. |

| `Range` | int | 640 | Search range in pixels, only switch anchor when the target is less than this far from owner. |
| `StopRange` | int | 0 | Makes the companion stop moving towards anchor at this range (in pixels). |
| `Filters` | List\<string\> | _null_ | List of anchor mode specific filters, see the headings on each Mode for details. If not specified, then no filters have been implemented. |
| `RequiredAbilities` | List\<string\>? | _mode dependent_  | List of ability classes to check for to determine if this anchor should be enabled. Some modes have default values, which can be cleared by setting this value to `null`. |

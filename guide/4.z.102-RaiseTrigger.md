# RaiseTrigger

Raise the [trigger](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Trigger_actions) `"mushymato.TrinketTinker/TrinketProc"`.

The trigger action handler will recieve `player` and `location` (nullable), as well as the trinket item as both `targetItem` and `inputItem`.

Can have niche uses, but it is generally better to directly call the registered delegate with the [Action](4.z.100-Action.md) ability.

## [Args](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.Mixin.NoArgs.yml)

No additional arguments.

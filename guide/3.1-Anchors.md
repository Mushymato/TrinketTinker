# Anchor Mode

A companion's motion is relative to another entity's position, generally the player.

`Anchors` consist of a list of [AnchorTargetData](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.AnchorTargetData.yml)

The order matters as companion will try for anchors in order, and stop once a valid one is found.
When none of the anchors are valid, fallback to `Owner`.

## Structure

| Property | Type | Default | Notes |
| -------- | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| `Mode` | [AnchorTarget](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.AnchorTarget.yml) | Owner | Anchor target, described below. |
| `Range` | int | 640 | Search range in pixels, only switch anchor when the target is less than this far from owner. |

### Monster

### Forage

### Object

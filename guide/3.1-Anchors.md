# Anchor Mode

A companion's motion is relative to another entity's position, generally the player.

`Anchors` consist of a list of [AnchorTargetData](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.AnchorTargetData.yml)

The order matters as companion will try for anchors in order, and stop once a target is found for a given anchor mode.
When no targets are found, fallback to `Owner`.

## Structure

| Property | Type | Default | Notes |
| -------- | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| `Mode` | [AnchorTarget](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.AnchorTarget.yml) | Owner | Anchor target, described below. |
| `Range` | int | 640 | Search range in pixels, only switch anchor when the target is less than this far from owner. |
| `Filters` | `List<string>` | _empty_ | List of anchor mode specific filters, see the headings on each Mode for details. If not specified, then the filter is irrelevant for the type. |

### Monster

Filters is a list of monsters to avoid targeting, based on their key in Data/Monsters.

### Forage

### Object

Anchor to nearest object.

### Crop

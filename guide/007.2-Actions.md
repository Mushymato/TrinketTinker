# [Actions](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Trigger_actions)

Actions, sometimes called trigger actions, are little snippets of behavior that can be called in places that support action.

Trinket Tinker provide these special actions.

## mushymato.TrinketTinker_EquipHiddenTrinket

```
mushymato.TrinketTinker_EquipHiddenTrinket <trinket id> [level] [variant] [daysDuration] [createNew]
```

Equips a hidden trinket to the player. This trinket does not occupy the trinket slot, and does not require combat mastery.
Just like [EquipTrinket](004.z.200-EquipTrinket.md), the custom field `mushymato.TrinketTinker/DirectEquipOnly` can be used to exclude your trinket from being equipped by this action.

Level and Variant default to 0 and can be specified, randomize ("R") is not supported.

By default, daysDuration is 1, meaning the hidden trinket is removed automatically after sleeping once.
They can be made permanent with -1, and will stay until explicitly removed with the following action.

When a particular trinket ID has been equipped by this action for the first time, a trinket instance is created and stored. The next time this action is called on the same trinket ID, a preexisting trinket instance will be fetched if possible and it's level/variant will be updated to match the arguments given to the action. The `createNew` optional argument overrides this behavior such that a new trinket is created every time.

## mushymato.TrinketTinker_UnequipHiddenTrinket

```
mushymato.TrinketTinker_UnequipHiddenTrinket <trinket id> [level] [variant]
```

Unequip a hidden trinket, optionally matching for a specific level and variant.
If the player has multiple copies of a trinket that matches ID (and level/variant if specified), the most recently equipped hidden trinket is removed first.

## mushymato.TrinketTinker_ProcTrinket

```
mushymato.TrinketTinker_ProcTrinket <trinket id> [level] [variant]
```

Activates all abilities with [Proc=Trigger](004.0-Proc.md), filtered to only trinkets of matching ID if it is specified.
This is a niche case, primarily for bespoke logic implemented in SMAPI mods.

## mushymato.TrinketTinker_ToggleCompanion

```
mushymato.TrinketTinker_ToggleCompanion <trinket id> [level] [variant]
```

Toggles the companion's visibility between visible and invisible. This is purely visual and does not prevent the abilities from activating.

Level and variant are purely used for disambiguation.

##  mushymato.TrinketTinker_PutHatOnCompanion

```
mushymato.TrinketTinker_PutHatOnCompanion <trinket id> <trinket id> [level] [variant]
```

Gives a hat to the companion. The hat will always be a newly created item and whether the companion "keeps" the hat depends on the [`HatEquip`](002-Variant.md) setting.

Level and variant are purely used for disambiguation.

# [Triggers]

## mushymato.TrinketTinker/TrinketProc

- Raised when using [RaiseTrigger](004.z.102-RaiseTrigger.md) ability.

## mushymato.TrinketTinker_DayStarted

- Raised right after TrinketTinker finishes it's day started processing, which a specific time later than the vanilla DayStarted.
- Use this if you need to check trinket related conditions in your trigger action.

# Speech Bubbles

Speech bubbles are a way to have the companion "speak" by drawing overhead text.
Currently, the only way to activate a speech bubble is through [ability](4-Ability.md) activation with `ProcSpeechBubble` set to the desired key.

This particular feature uses the same system vanilla does for overhead NPC text, so the amount of customization is limited. If you need something fancier, you will have to use [temporary animated sprites](5-Temporary%20Animated%20Sprite.md) to show/animate a custom sprite featuring your text.

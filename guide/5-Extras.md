## Machine: Trinket Colorizer ![Trinket Colorizer](~/images/favicon.png)

A new machine that can be purchased from [the Blacksmith](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Blacksmith) for 50 [Gold Bars](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Gold_Bar) once the [Anvil](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Anvil) recipe is obtained.

Consumes 3 [Star Shards](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Star_Shards) to reroll the variant on a TrinketTinker trinket, no effect on vanilla trinkets.

The Trinket Colorizer is just a normal machine with qualified id `(BC)mushymato.TrinketTinker_TrinketColorizer`, mods are free to add their own machine rules.

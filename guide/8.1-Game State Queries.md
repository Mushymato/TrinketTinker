# [Game State Queries](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Game_state_queries)

Game state queries are expressions that return true or false, they can be used in various Condition fields in both TrinketTinker and elsewhere in game. Though the game state queries added by trinket tinker are very specific in their use case.

## mushymato.TrinketTinker_IS_TINKER

```
mushymato.TrinketTinker_IS_TINKER <Input|Target|ItemId> [level compare] [variant compare]
```

Check if the item indicated by key is a trinket with tinker data and has a certain amount of level and a certain amount of variant.

The argument format here is shared by other trinket tinker GSQ arguments of the same style.

### Trinket Item <Input|Target|ItemId>

- Input: This is the input item from a machine trigger rule. For trinket tinker conditions, this will usually be the trinket item.
- Output: This is the target item, which is more general. For trinket tinker conditions, this will usually be the trinket item.
- ItemId: This is a item id (best if qualified). A new instance of the item will be created and checked against condition, which means level 0 and variant 0 in context of trinkets from trinket tinker.

### Level and Variant Compare

These take a compare operation with format of [Operator][Compare Value], e.g. <=1 for less than or equal to 1.

_Valid operators_: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==` (& `=`), `!=`.

The compare value is an integer (i.e. 2, not 2.5). Can also use `M` for maximum unlocked level/variant.

To skip level and only compare variant (or vice versa), use `?` for level.


## mushymato.TrinketTinker_ENABLED_TRINKET_COUNT

```
mushymato.TrinketTinker_ENABLED_TRINKET_COUNT <Input|Target|ItemId> <playerKey> <equip count compare>
```



## mushymato.TrinketTinker_HAS_LEVELS

```
mushymato.TrinketTinker_HAS_LEVELS <Input|Target|ItemId>
```

Check if the trinket item has tinker and has at least 2 unlocked levels.


## mushymato.TrinketTinker_HAS_VARIANTS

```
mushymato.TrinketTinker_HAS_VARIANTS <Input|Target|ItemId>
```

Check if the trinket item has tinker and has at least 2 unlocked levels.

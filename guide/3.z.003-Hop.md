# Bounce

Like [Lerp](3.z.000-Lerp.md) motion, but the companion leaps from point to point, following the start and end positions set by lerp.

To have the companion show an alternate animation while bouncing, set a `"Jump"` [animation clip](3.2-Animation%20Clips.md) with the desired frame start, frame length, etc.

The difference between Hop and [Bounce](3.z.002-Bounce.md) is that hop is synchronized with lerp start and end positions. Due ot reliance on lerp, hop motion appears janky in multiplayer.

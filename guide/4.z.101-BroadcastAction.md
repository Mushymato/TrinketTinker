# BroadcastAction

Run an registered [action](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Trigger_actions), either vanilla or mod provided, on another player.

This is a specialized version of [Action](4.z.100-Action.md) meant for niche cases where a particular action only properly works on the host, or if the trinket should effect another player and not the main player.

## [Args](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.AbilityArgs.BroadcastActionArgs.yml)

| Property | Type | Default | Notes |
| -------- | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| `Condition` | string | **required** | A [game state query](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Game_state_queries), checked on the remote player actually running the action. |
| `PlayerKey` | string | **required** | Players to target, accepts these values:<ul><li>All: run action on all players</li><li>Host: run action on the host player</li></ul> |

*and all arguments of [Action](4.z.100-Action.md)

## For SMAPI Mods

Unlike Action, BroadcastAction does not provide custom fields provided for modded actions to use.

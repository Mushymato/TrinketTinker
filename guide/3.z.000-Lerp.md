# Lerp

The companion follows the anchor at a distance. They will move as fast as they need to in order to stay within the desired distance.

Lerp motion operate by this logic, using a `lerp` variable between 0 and 1.
1. If the companion is too far (>`Max`) from the anchor position, teleport to the anchor.
2. If the companion is far enough (>`Min`) from the anchor position,
    - Record companion current position as start.
    - Pick an end position based on the anchor.
    - Enter lerping state.
3. When start and end positions are set, increase `lerp` by value relative to elapsed game time, then calculate companion position with `start + (end - start) * lerp`.
4. Once `lerp` reach 1 (and thus the companion reached the end position), exit lerping state.
5. This completes 1 lerp step, and the companion will try to initiate new lerp state in the next game update tick.

## [Args](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.MotionArgs.LerpArgs.yml)

| Property | Type | Default | Notes |
| -------- | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| `Min` | float | 80 | Min distance from anchor, the companion does not move until they are this far from the anchor. |
| `Max` | float | 640 | Max distance from anchor, if the companion is farther away than this, teleport. |
| `Rate` | float | 400 | Miliseconds needed to complete 1 lerp, higher number makes companion take larger but slower lerp steps. |
| `Pause` | float | 0 | Pause between picking next position to lerp to. |
| `MoveSync` | bool | false | When true, only allow companion to move when the player moves. |
| `Jitter` | float | 0f | Add randomness to movement, if greater than 0 and `AlwaysMoving` is true, the companion will randomly move around the anchor while within minimum range. |

# EquipTrinket

This ability requires [inventory](005.0-Inventory.md) to use, and can only be used with [Proc Always](004.0-Proc.md). Only 1 EquipTrinket ability can exist per level, and having this ability changes this trinket's inventory to only accept trinkets (that do not have inventory). Inventory cannot be opened while this trinket is equipped.

The reason for all the special caveats is because this ability turns a trinket into a holder for additional trinkets. By equipping this trinket, all trinkets within the inventory of this trinket is also equipped.

For mod authors, your trinket can be explictly banned from this ability with a `Data/Trinkets` custom field.

```json
{
  "Action": "EditData",
  "Target": "Data/Trinkets",
  "Entries": {
    "{{ModId}}_YourOPTrinket": {
      "Id": "{{ModId}}_YourOPTrinket",
      // other fields omitted...
      "CustomFields": {
        // prevent this trinket from being equipped indirectly via EquipTrinket and the trinket equip action.
        "mushymato.TrinketTinker/DirectEquipOnly": "T"
      }
    },
  }
}

# Speech Bubbles

Speech bubbles are a way to have the companion "speak" by drawing overhead text.
Currently, the only way to activate a speech bubble is through [ability](004-Ability.md) activation with `ProcSpeechBubble` set to the desired key.

This particular feature uses overhead NPC text from the base game, so the amount of customization is limited. If you need something fancier, you will have to use [temporary animated sprites](006-Temporary%20Animated%20Sprite.md) to show/animate a custom sprite featuring your text.

## Structure

| Property | Type | Default | Notes |
| -------- | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| `Text` | string | `"Hey, Listen!"` | The text to put in a bubble. |
| `Timer` | double | 3000 | Amount of time in miliseconds to display this bubble. |
| `Offset` | Vector2 | 0,0 | By default, the text is drawn above the companion's sprite, this adds additional offset on top. |
| `Color` | string | _null_ | Speech text color.<br>Aside from RGB and hex values, monogame accepts [named colors](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color.html) and this mod accepts special value `"Prismatic"` for an animated color cycle. |
| `ScrollType` | int | 1 | Type of scroll(background) to draw, 0 1 2 3 4 all give valid backgrounds. |
| `LayerDepth` | float | 1 | Layer depth offset from the companion's draw layer depth. |
| `JunimoText` | bool | false | Layer depth offset from the companion's draw layer depth. |
| `FadeIn` | float | 0.1 | Percent of timer to spend in fade in (transparent to solid). |
| `FadeOut` | float | 0.1 | Percent of timer to spend in fade out (solid to transparent). Another clip is allowed to interrupt the current clip during this time. |
| `Shake` | int | 0 | If greater than 0, randomly offset the draw position each frame. |
| `Condition` | string | `"FALSE"` | A [game state query](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Game_state_queries) used to check if this speech bubble is allowed to play. Note that unlike most `Condition` checked by Trinket Tinker, this one does not receive the trinket as Input/Target item. |
| `RandomSpeech` | List\<SpeechBubbleData\> | _null_ | Allows extra random anim clips to be provided for this key, only relevant for the top level anim clip. |
| `RandomWeight` | int | 1 | Weight of this random speech. Higher weight relative to other clips makes it more frequent. |
| `Nop` | bool | false | Indicates a no-op speech that does nothing, for use with `RandomSpeech`. |

## Random Clips

`RandomSpeech` allows one speech bubble key to be associated with multiple clips, to be chosen by random. The speec bubble is rolled each proc.

`RandomWeight` can be thought of as frequence. If there are 3 speech bubbles with `RandomWeight` of 1 2 3, the weight 1 bubbles will appear 1 in 6 times, while the weight 3 bubbles will appear 3 in 6 times, or 1 in 2.

The randomization logic here is identical to `RandomClips` for [anim clips](003.2-Animation%20Clips.md).

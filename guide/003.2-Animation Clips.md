# Animation Clips

Beyond the basic [directional movement animation](003.0-Direction.md), companions can also have special animation states triggered by either a motion or an ability. These extra animations must live on the same sprite sheet and have the start frame + frame length specified as an entry in [Motion](003-Motion.md) `AnimClips`, with the right key.

The start frame counts up from 0 and can be any frame on the sheet, including the previously discussed movement frames. Consider these 2 situations:
1. The clip reuses frames in the directional animation:
    - No new frames added.
    - Count to the desired starting frame by going left to right, up to down.
1. The clip's frames are unique:
    - Append new frames to the end of the animation sheet.
    - Count the length of the directional animation (e.g. 4*4 = 16), this will be the start frame.
    - Additional clips that follow would start even later of course.

> [!TIP]
> The console command `tt.draw_debug` is helpful for debugging animation frames in game.

Animation clips can be played back once (oneshot), or continuously played over the directional movement animation (override). This is decided by particular motions/abilities/states that request the animation.

## Structure

| Property | Type | Default | Notes |
| -------- | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| `Condition` | string | `"FALSE"` | A [game state query](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Game_state_queries) used to check if this clip is allowed to play. Note that unlike most `Condition` checked by Trinket Tinker, this one does not receive the trinket as Input/Target item and will not work if a given query is meant to check for a trinket item there. |
| `FrameStart` | int | 0 | First frame/sprite index of the animation clip. |
| `FrameLength` | int | 4 | Length of the animation clip. |
| `LoopMode` | [LoopMode](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.LoopMode.yml) | Standard | Control animation playback. <ul><li>Standard: 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4</li><li>PingPong:  1 2 3 4 3 2 1</li><ul> |
| `Flip` | SpriteEffects | None | Sprite draw effect, one of `None`, `FlipHorizontally`, `FlipVertically`. This changes how the sprite is drawn for this particular anim clip. |
| `Interval` | float | _null_ | Milisecond Interval between animation frames. If this is not set, use the Motion's interval. |
| `PauseMovement` | bool | false | If true, pause movement update of this animation clip if it plays as a one shot anim clip. |
| `UseExtra` | bool | false | If true, try to use `TextureExtra` instead of `Texture` from [Variant](002-Variant.md). |
| `RandomClips` | List\<AnimClipData\> | _null_ | Allows extra random anim clips to be provided for this key, only relevant for the top level anim clip. |
| `RandomWeight` | int | 1 | Weight of random clip, if provided. Higher weight relative to other clips makes it more frequent. |
| `Nop` | bool | false | Indicates a no-op clip that does nothing but takes up time (and thus prevent another clip from being selected in the meantime), for use with `RandomClips`. |

## Priority

At each update, clips are evaluated in this order: oneshot > override > swiming > moving(anchor) > moving(directional) > idle

## Random Clips

`RandomClips` allows one clip key to be associated with multiple clips, to be chosen at random. The base clip is included as part of the random, while `RandomClips` elements serve as additional possibilities.

For oneshot clips, the random is checked once before they play. For override clips, random is rechecked at the end of 1 cycle of clip. To have a case where no clip is rolled, set `Nop` on a clip. When a `Nop=true` clip is chosen, the next recheck of random will be delayed by `Interval * FrameLength`, thus the frame number/interval is still meaningful.

`RandomWeight` is a way to describe chance that a clip will be picked. If there are 3 clips with `RandomWeight` of 1 2 3, the weight 1 clip will appear 1 in 6 times, while the weight 3 clip will appear 3 in 6 times, or 1 in 2.

Clips inside `RandomClips` may not have their own `RandomClips`, any data there is ignored.

The randomization logic here is identical to `RandomSpeech` for [speech bubbles](003.3-Speech%20Bubbles.md).

## Available Clips

### Directional AnimClip Keys

All anim keys can take on a directional index suffix such as `"{KEY}.1"` which depends on the [direction mode](003.0-Direction.md). The suffix takes the absolute value of the index, no need to manually flip sprites for negative direction index.

Example: when the direction index is `1` (perhaps because they are facing downwards in `DRUL` mode) and the player is not moving, `"Idle.1"` will be picked if available, and if not we fallback to `"Idle"`.

### Motion Defined Keys

These animation are applied when companion enter a state defined by particular motion, except for `"Idle"`, which applies for all motions. These are considered "override" anim clips, which play until the player or trinket leaves the specified state.

| Key | Motion | Note |
| --- | ------ | ---- |
| `"Perching"` | [Hover](003.z.001-Hover.md) | Applies when companion perches on the player after a timeout, this is an override key. Perching follows static motion rules about directions (i.e. always faces same direction as player). |
| `"Jump"` | [Bounce](003.z.002-Bounce.md), [Hop](003.z.003-Hop.md) | Applies when the companion is jumping, this is an override key. |
| `"Idle"` | All Motions | Played when the player is not moving, Does nothing if companion is marked `AlwaysMoving` which forces regular directional animation to continue. |
| `"Swim"` | All Motions | Played when the player is swiming, supercedes movement and idle animation. |

### Anchor Defined Keys

These keys activate while the companion is locked into a particular anchor, and cease once they are no longer targeting that anchor.

| Key | Note |
| --- | ---- |
| `"Anchor.<Mode>"` | The mode referred to here is an anchor mode, see [Anchors](003.1-Anchors.md). |

### Ability Defined Keys

These keys are defined by mod, in specified models.

| Field | Model | Note |
| ----- | ----- | ---- |
| `ProcOneshotAnim` | [AbilityData](004-Ability.md) | Play the clip once on ability proc. This is a oneshot animation, after 1 cycle is finished the companion returns to normal directional animation. |

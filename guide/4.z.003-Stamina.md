# Stamina

Recover some amount of energy. If Min and Max are negative, this ability will drain the player's energy instead.

The `Min` and `Max` values is a double, meaning:
- If you want 5.5% of current Stamina, use `"Percent"` (default value) and `0.055`
- If you want 5.5 stamina, use `"Number"` and `5.5`

If this is used with a [Proc](4.0-Proc.md) that involves damage (`ReceiveDamage`, `DamageMonster`, `SlayMonster`), then the Percent is relative to the damage. Otherwise it is relative to the player's max stamina.

Stamina is a float, so you can recover/lose 1.5 stamina (the visual number on screen rounds down and shows 1 in that case).

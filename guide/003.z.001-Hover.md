# Hover

Like [Lerp](003.z.000-Lerp.md) motion, but the companion is drawn some distance away from their shadow, making them seem like they are hovering.

They also do a little bit of periodic bobbing motion.

The offset can be controlled with [motion offset](003-Motion.md).

## [Args](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.MotionArgs.HoverArgs.yml)

| Property | Type | Default | Notes |
| -------- | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| `Magnitude` | float | 16 | Amount of up and down bobbing in pixels. |
| `Period` | float | 800 | Period of the bobbing motion in miliseconds. |
| `PerchingTimeout` | float | _null_ | If set, companion will try to perch on the player when the player is still for this many miliseconds. |
| `PerchingOffset` | Vector2 | 0,0 | Postion offset when perching, must use the string `"x,y"` format. |

*and all arguments of [Lerp](003.z.000-Lerp.md)

### Perching

When `PerchingTimeout` is set to a non-null value, the companion will "land" on the player's head after the timeout elapses.

To have the companion show an alternate animation, set a `"Perching"` [animation clip](003.2-Animation%20Clips.md) with the desired frame start, frame length, etc.

`PerchingOffset` changes the perching position, relative the default  `"Perching"` position.

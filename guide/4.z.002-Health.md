# Health

Recover some amount of HP. If Min and Max are negative, this ability will damage the player instead.

The `Min` and `Max` values is a double, meaning:
- If you want 5% of current HP, use `"Percent"` (default value) and `0.05`
- If you want 5 HP, use `"Number"` and `5`

If this is used with a [Proc](4.0-Proc.md) that involves damage (`ReceiveDamage`, `DamageMonster`, `SlayMonster`), then the Percent is relative to the damage. Otherwise it is relative to the player's max HP.

Health is an integer and will always be a whole number, this ability will round up the healed value.

# Inventory

Trinkets can have inventory, which can be opened by "using" the trinket item. This menu can also be accessed when the trinket is equipped via a [keybinding](009-User%20Configuration.md). This inventory can accept most items except for itself and other trinkets that have inventory. Further control of what is allowed into an inventory can be achieved through `RequiredTags` and `RequiredItemCondition`.

Should the trinket item be lost or become unreachable, all items inside will be sent to the lost and found on the next day. This applies to inventories that belong to [hidden trinkets](007.2-Actions.md) when they are dismissed.

There's a number of caveats when using inventory with [EquipTrinket](004.z.200-EquipTrinket.md), refer to that page for details.

## Sample

```json
{
  "Action": "EditData",
  "Target": "mushymato.TrinketTinker/Tinker",
  "TargetField": [
    "{{ModId}}_Sample"
  ],
  "Entries": {
    "Inventory": {
      "Capacity": <inventory size>,
      "OpenCondition": "<game state query>",
      "RequiredTags": [
        "<context tag>"
      ],
      "RequiredItemCondition": "<game state query with Input/Target>"
    }
  }
}
```

## Structure

| Property | Type | Default | Notes |
| -------- | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| `Capacity` | int | 9 | Capacity of the inventory. |
| `OpenCondition` | string | _null_ | A [game state query](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Game_state_queries) used to check if this inventory can be opened to accept objects. |
| `RequiredTags` | List\<string\> | _null_ | A list of [context tags](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Common_data_field_types#Context_tag) used to check if an item should be allowed into the inventory. Each space separated sub list of tags act as AND while the overall list act as OR. |
| `RequiredItemCondition` | string | _null_ | A [game state query](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Game_state_queries) used to check if an item should be allowed into the inventory. The item being checked will be provided as the Input and Target. |

# Proc

Proc determines when an ability activate, kind of like the trigger in a trigger action. The word "proc" is gamer slang for "activate", used because it's only 4 letters long.

The Proc value is not the only factor on whether ability will activate. It must pass any timeout and conditions listed in [abilites](4-Ability.md).

In content patcher, use a string value like `"Proc": "Always"` to set this value. Internally it is an [enum](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.ProcOn.yml).

## ProcOn

- **Footstep**: When the player walks around.
- **ReceiveDamage**: When the player is damanged.
- **DamageMonster**: When the player damages a monster.
- **SlayMonster**: When the player slays a monster.
- **Timer**: Activate whenever timer elapses, must set `ProcTimer`.
- **Trigger**: When the [trigger](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Trigger_actions) "mushymato.TrinketTinker/ProcTrinket" is raised.
    - If the unqualified trinket Id is given (e.g. "mushymato.TrinketTinker/ProcTrinket MyTrinket"), only the specified trinket's ablities will proc.
- **Always**: Activate the ability once on equip, deactivate it on unequip. Mainly useful as a way to give a persistent [Buff](4.1.1-Buff.md).
- **Use**: When used (right click while selected in hotbar).

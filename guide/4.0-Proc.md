# Proc

Proc determines when an ability activate, kind of like the trigger in a trigger action. The word "proc" is gamer slang for "activate", used because it's only 4 letters long.

The Proc value is not the only factor on whether ability will activate. It must pass any timeout and conditions listed in [abilites](4-Ability.md).

In content patcher, use a string value like `"Proc": "Always"` to set this value. Internally it is an [enum](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.ProcOn.yml).

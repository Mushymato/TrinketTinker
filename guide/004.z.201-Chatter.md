# Chatter

This ability is used to activate Chatter dialogue, which produces full dialogue boxes much like NPC dialogue.

Chatter data is stored on the [tinker asset](001-Tinker.md), as `Dictionary<string, ChatterLinesData>`, while the portrait, NPC, or display name is stored with [variants](002-Variant.md). On ability activation, one set of `ChatterLinesData` will be picked based on priority and `Condition`, then one line out of the list will be chosen.

See [this page](005.1-Chatter.md) for more info about chatter related data.

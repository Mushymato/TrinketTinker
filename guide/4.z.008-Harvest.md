# Harvest

There are several Harvest type abilities that generally "harvest" things from the world. Each share the same arguments and have similar behavior, but target different harvestable things.

Companions can be set to seek nearby harvestable targets using [anchors](3.1-Anchors.md), refer to below table for corresponding anchor mode.

| Name | Anchor | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| `"HarvestCrop"` | `"Crop"` | Harvest ready crops. |
| `"HarvestForage"` | `"Forage"` | Harvest forage items. |
| `"HarvestStone"` | `"Stone"` | Harvest breakable stone and ores. |
| `"HarvestShakeable"` | `"Shakeable"` | Harvest shakeable things (tree, fruit tree, bush). Will not harvest golden walnut bush. |
| `"HarvestTwig"` | `"Twig"` | Harvest twig debris. |
| `"HarvestWeed"` | `"Weed"` | Harvest weeds debris. |
| `"HarvestDigSpot"` | `"DigSpot"` | Harvest dig spots (artifact spot or seed spot). |

## [Args](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.AbilityArgs.HarvestArgs.yml)

| Property | Type | Default | Notes |
| -------- | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| `Range` | int | 1 | Tile radius around companion, 0 for the tile the companion is on, 1 for 3x3, 2 for 5x5, and so on. |
| `Count` | int | 1 | Number of tiles to check for activation within the radius. |
| `HarvestTo` | [HarvestDestination](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.AbilityArgs.HarvestDestination.yml) | Player | Where to send the harvested item. |
| `Filters` | List\<string\> | _null_ | Filter string arguments. |
| `ShowHarvestedItem` | bool | true | Show the item that was harvested, if `HarvestTo` is either `"Player"` or `"TinkerInventory"`. |

## [HarvestTo](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.AbilityArgs.HarvestDestination.yml)

This arg determines where the harvested item is sent to.

- **None**: The item is lost into the void
- **Debris**: A dropped item/debris is created and can be collected by the player
- **Player**: An item is added to the player inventory, if space allows. Otherwise the item either becomes debris or is not harvested (Forage).
- **TinkerInventory**: An item is added to the [trinket's inventory](5-Inventory.md), if space allows. Otherwise the item either becomes debris or is not harvested (Forage).

## Filters

This arg allows certain harvestable targets to be excluded, exact effect depends on ability type. If an ability is not listed here, then it has no support for filters.

- `"HarvestCrop"` & `"HarvestForage"`: List of [context tags](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Common_data_field_types#Context_tag) to avoid harvesting, e.g. `"category_flowers"` (exclude flower category) or `"color_orange season_summer"` (exclude orange and summer). Each space separated sub list of tags act as AND while the overall list act as OR.
- `"HarvestShakeable"`: Take list of `"Bush"`, `"Tree"`, `"FruitTree"`, indicating which of the 3 possible categories to avoid shaking.

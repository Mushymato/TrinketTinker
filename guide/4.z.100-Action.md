# Action

Run an registered [action](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Trigger_actions), either vanilla or mod provided.

`ActionEnd` and `ActionsEnd` are relevant when `ProcOn` is `Always`. These end actions are called when the player unequips a trinket, or overnight when the game unequip and reequips the trinket.

## [Args](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.AbilityArgs.ActionArgs.yml)

| Property | Type | Default | Notes |
| -------- | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| `Action` | string | **required** | An action to run. |
| `Actions` | string | _null_ | Additional actions to run. |
| `ActionEnd` | string | _null_ | An action to run when the trinket is unequiped. |
| `ActionsEnd` | string | _null_ | Additional actions to run. |

## For SMAPI Mods

The actions triggered by this ability have special `TriggerActionContext.CustomFields` values which can be used from custom actions.

| Key | Type | Notes |
| --- | ---- | ----- |
| `mushymato.TrinketTinker/Trinket` | `StardewValley.Objects.Trinkets.Trinket` | The trinket which owns the ability that ran this action. |
| `mushymato.TrinketTinker/Owner` | `StardewValley.Farmer` | The farmer who equipped the trinket. |
| `mushymato.TrinketTinker/Position` | `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2` | The position of the companion, or _null_ if there is no companion. |
| `mushymato.TrinketTinker/Data` | [`TrinketTinker.Models.AbilityData`](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.AbilityData.yml) | The trinket ability data model, this is not converted by pintail so you must use reflection to access any fields, fragile. |

These custom fields provide a way for C# mods to implement their own ability effects as actions, which can then be put into trinket tinker.

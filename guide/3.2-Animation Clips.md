# Animation Clips

Beyond the basic [directional movement animation](3.0-Direction.md), companions can also have special animation states triggered by either a motion or an ability. These extra animations must live on the same sprite sheet and have the start frame + frame length specified as an entry in [Motion](3-Motion.md) `AnimClips`, with the right key.

The start frame counts up from 0 and can be any frame on the sheet, including the previously discussed movement frames. Consider these 2 situations:
1. The clip reuses frames in the directional animation:
    - No new frames added.
    - Count to the desired starting frame by going left to right, up to down.
1. The clip's frames are unique:
    - Append new frames to the end of the animation sheet.
    - Count the length of the directional animation (e.g. 4*4 = 16), this will be the start frame.
    - Additional clips that follow would start even later of course.

> [!TIP]
> The console command `tt_draw_debug` is helpful for debugging animation frames in game.

Animation clips can be played back once (oneshot), or continuously played over the directional movement animation (override). This is decided by particular motions/abilities/states that request the animation.

## Structure

| Property | Type | Default | Notes |
| -------- | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| `FrameStart` | int | 0 | First frame/sprite index of the animation clip. |
| `FrameLength` | int | 4 | Length of the animation clip. |
| `LoopMode` | [LoopMode](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.LoopMode.yml) | Standard | Control animation playback. <ul><li>Standard: 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4</li><li>PingPong:  1 2 3 4 3 2 1</li><ul> |
| `Interval` | float | _null_ | Milisecond Interval between animation frames. If this is not set, use the Motion's interval. |
| `PauseMovement` | bool | false | If true, pause movement update of this animation clip if it plays as a one shot anim clip. |
| `RandomClips` | List\<AnimClipData\> | _null_ | Allows extra random anim clips to be provided for this key, only relevant for the top level anim clip. |
| `RandomWeight` | int | 1 | Weight of random clip, if provided. Higher weight relative to other clips makes it more frequent. |
| `Nop` | bool | false | Indicates a no-op clip that does nothing, for use with `RandomClips`. |

## Priority

At each update, clips are evaluated in this order: oneshot > override > swiming > moving(anchor) > moving(directional) > idle

## Random Clips

`RandomClips` allows one clip key to be associated with multiple clips, to be chosen by random. For oneshot clips, the random is checked once before they play. For override clips, random is rechecked at the end of 1 cycle of clip. To have a case where no clip is rolled, set `Nop` on a clip. When a `Nop=true` clip is chosen, the next recheck of random will be delayed by `Interval * FrameLength`, thus the frame number/interval is still meaningful.

`RandomWeight` can be thought of as frequence. If there are 3 clips with `RandomWeight` of 1 2 3, the weight 1 clip will appear 1 in 6 times, while the weight 3 clip will appear 3 in 6 times, or 1 in 2.

Clips inside `RandomClips` may not have their own `RandomClips`.

The randomization logic here is identical to `RandomSpeech` for [speech bubbles](3.3-Speech%20Bubbles.md).

## Available Clips

### Directional AnimClip Keys

All anim keys can take on a directional index suffix such as `"{KEY}.1"` which depends on the [direction mode](3.0-Direction.md). The suffix takes the absolute value of the index, no need to manually flip sprites for negative direction index.

Example: when the direction index is `1` and the player is still, `"Idle.1"` will be picked if available, fallback to `"Idle"`.

### Motion Defined Keys

These animation are applied when companion enter a state defined by particular motion, except for `"Idle"`, which applies for all motions. These are considered "override" anim clips, which play until the player or trinket leaves the specified state.

| Key | Motion | Note |
| --- | ------ | ---- |
| `"Perching"` | [Hover](3.z.001-Hover.md) | Applies when companion perches on the player after a timeout, this is an override key. Perching follows static motion rules about directions (i.e. always faces same direction as player). |
| `"Jump"` | [Bounce](3.z.002-Bounce.md), [Hop](3.z.003-Hop.md) | Applies when the companion is jumping, this is an override key. |
| `"Idle"` | All Motions | Played when the player is not moving, Does nothing if companion is marked `AlwaysMoving` which forces regular directional animation to continue. |
| `"Swim"` | All Motions | Played when the player is swiming, supercedes movement and idle animation. |

### Anchor Defined Keys

These keys activate while the companion is locked into a particular anchor, and cease once they are no longer targeting that anchor.

| Key | Note |
| --- | ---- |
| `"Anchor.<Mode>"` | The mode referred to here is an anchor mode, see [Anchors](3.1-Anchors.md). |

### Ability Defined Keys

These keys are defined by mod, in specified models.

| Field | Model | Note |
| ----- | ----- | ---- |
| `ProcOneshotAnim` | [AbilityData](4-Ability.md) | Play the clip once on ability proc. This is a oneshot animation, after 1 cycle is finished the companion returns to normal directional animation. |

# Animation Clips

Beyond the basic [directional movement animation](3.0-Direction.md), companions can also have special animation states triggered by either a motion or an ability. These extra animations must live on the same sprite sheet and have the start frame + frame length specified in `AnimData`, with the right key.

Animation clips can be played back once (oneshot), or continuously played over the directional movement animation (override). This is decided by particular motions/abilities that request the animation.

## Structure

| Property | Type | Default | Notes |
| -------- | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| `FrameStart` | int | 0 | First frame/sprite index of the animation clip. |
| `FrameLength` | int | 4 | Length of the animation clip. |
| `LoopMode` | [LoopMode](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.LoopMode.yml) | Standard | Control animation playback. <ul><li>Standard: 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4</li><li>PingPong:  1 2 3 4 3 2 1</li><ul> |
| `Interval` | float | _empty_ | Milisecond Interval between animation frames. If this is not set, use the Motion's interval. |

## AnimClip Keys

### Idle Animation

Applies when the player is not moving. Does nothing if companion is marked `AlwaysMoving`, as their directional animation will simply continue.

| Key | Note |
| --- | ---- |
| `"Idle.1"` | For the first [direction](3.0-Direction.md), Down if DRUL.|
| `"Idle.2"` | For the second [direction](3.0-Direction.md), Right if DRUL |
| `"Idle.3"` | For the third [direction](3.0-Direction.md), Up if DRUL. |
| `"Idle.4"` | For the fourth [direction](3.0-Direction.md), Left if DRUL. |
| `"Idle.0"` | General directionless idle animation. |

### Motion Specific State Animation

Applies when a particular motion enters alternate state beyond the simple moving vs idle.

| Key | Source | Note |
| --- | ------ | ---- |
| `"Perching"` | [Hover](3.z.001-Hover.md) | Applies when companion perches on the player after a timeout. |
| `"Jump"` | [Bounce](3.z.002-Bounce.md) and [Hop](3.z.003-Hop.md) | Applies when the companion jumped. |

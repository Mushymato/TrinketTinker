# Animation Clips

Beyond the basic [directional movement animation](3.0-Direction.md), companions can also have special animation states triggered by either a motion or an ability. These extra animations must live on the same sprite sheet and have the start frame + frame length specified in `AnimData`, with the right key.

Animation clips can be played back once (oneshot), or continuously played over the directional movement animation (override).

## Structure

| `FrameStart` | int | 0 | First frame/sprite index of the animation clip. |
| `FrameLength` | int | 4 | Length of the animation clip. |
| `LoopMode` | [LoopMode](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.LoopMode.yml) | Standard | Control animation playback. <ul><li>Standard: 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4</li><li>PingPong:  1 2 3 4 3 2 1</li><ul> |
| `Interval` | float | _empty_ | Milisecond Interval between animation frames. If this is not set, use the Motion's interval. |

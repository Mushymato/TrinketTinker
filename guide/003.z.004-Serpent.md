# Serpent

Draws additional body segments that follow the base sprite, which is treated as the head.

Requires 2 additional sets of sprites for the body segments and tail. The number per set required is the determined by [direction](003.0-Direction.md) and frame length, just like the base sprite number. A minimal serpent would require just 3 sprites (head, segment, tail), using direction mode Single with frame length of 1. Serpent frame

To have the head rotate as well, set `DirectionRotate` to true.

| Property | Type | Default | Notes |
| -------- | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| `SegmentCount` | int | 5 | Number of segments to draw, excluding the head. |
| `SegmentAlts` | int | 1 | Number of alternate segment appearanches, default 1 means only 1 kind of segment. Multiple kinds of segments will be drawn in alternating order. |
| `HasTail` | bool | true | Whether this serpent is capped off by a unique segment that comes immediately after the last (alt) segment. |
| `Sparcity` | float | 3.5 | A factor of sprite width determining how spaced out each segment is. The default value of 3.5 gives a little bit of overlap between segments. |

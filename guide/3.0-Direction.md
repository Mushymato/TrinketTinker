# Direction Mode

Direction mode determines number of sprites and the required arragements on the sprite sheet. This **only** describes number of sprites required, the sprite width and height is controlled by [variants](2-Variant.md).

In content patcher, use a string value like `"DirectionMode": "DRUL"` to set this value. Internally it is an [enum](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.DirectionMode.yml).

Arrangement charts in this page assumes `FrameLength` is 4, but you can have as many frames as desired. There's also no need to adhere to exact row layout as long as you have the correct number of sprites in the left to right \& up to down order.

## Single

Animate the sprite, ignore all changes to direction.
This is the default value.

**Number of Sprites Required**: `FrameLength`

## R - Right

Similar **Single** but the sprite is flipped when going left.

**Number of Sprites Required**: 1 x `FrameLength` (4 by default)

## DRUL - Down Right Up Left

This mode is similar to NPC and animal sprites in the base game. Four sets of animations are required, one per direction.

**Number of Sprites Required**: 4 x `FrameLength` (16 by default)

## DRU - Down Right Up

Similar to **DRUL**, but allows you to skip left facing sprites for symmetrical companions.

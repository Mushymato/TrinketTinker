# Direction Mode

Direction mode determines number of sprites and the required arragements on the sprite sheet. This **only** describes number of sprites required, the sprite width and height is controlled by [variants](2-Variant.md).

In content patcher, use a string value like `"DirectionMode": "DRUL"` to set this value. Internally it is an [enum](~/api/TrinketTinker.Models.yml).

Arrangement charts in this page assumes `AnimationFrameLength` is 4, but you can have as many frames as desired. There's also no need to adhere to exact row layout as long as you have the correct number of sprites in the left to right \& up to down order.

## DRUL - Down Right Up Left

This mode is similar to NPC and animal sprites in the base game.

**Number of Sprites Required**: 4 x `AnimationFrameLength` (16 by default)

## R - Right

This mode only requires 1 set of animations, there are no up or down sprites, and the sprite is flipped when going left.

**Number of Sprites Required**: 1 x `AnimationFrameLength` (4 by default)

## Rotate

Rather than a facing direction, the sprite rotates to point towards the anchor point, similar bugs & serpents.

The tip of the point is the right side of the sprite, rather than up.

**Number of Sprites Required**: 1 x `AnimationFrameLength` (4 by default)

**Number of Sprites Required**: 2 x `AnimationFrameLength` (8 by default)
